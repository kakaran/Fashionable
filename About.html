                <div class="desc">
                    <p class="para">As the very first ultra-luxury re-commerce brand of its kind, FASHIONPHILE is the
                        brainchild of
                        Founder and President, Sarah Davis. Like most of the brands we love best, FASHIONPHILE began in
                        1999, with little more than a good idea. In 2006, Sarah introduced business partner & CEO Ben
                        Hemminger, who evolved the brand by expanding the collection and presenting it to a larger
                        market.
                        Over 20 years later, FASHIONPHILE is now one of the world’s top resellers of pre-owned luxury
                        and
                        the exclusive re-commerce partner of Neiman Marcus. </p>
                    <p class="para">In the words of Geoffroy van Raemdonck, CEO of Neiman Marcus Group, “FASHIONPHILE’s
                        hyper-focus
                        on
                        curating high-quality supply and providing best-in-class shopping experiences makes it the ideal
                        partner.”</p>
                    <p class="para">When Neiman Marcus calls you ideal, you blush and just, well, let it in.</p>

            <div class="center">
                <h2 class="head">OUR PROMISE TO YOU</h2>
                <div class="desc">
                    <p class="para">Our customers don’t take promises lightly, and neither do we. The four you see here
                        represent our
                        deepest dedications, explorations, and well, our values at our core. We hope you take them to
                        heart
                        the way we have.</p>
                    <div>
                        <h2 class="head">1. WE MAKE AUTHENTICITY OUR FIRST PRIORITY.</h2>
                        <p class="para">And we don’t just mean our handbags, although authentication of our products is
                            essential and
                            come first in all we do. It’s why we’ve literally written the book on authentication, and
                            why
                            our process is one of the most in-depth in the industry.</p>

                        <h2 class="head">2. WHEN WE WANT SOMETHING, WE’RE ALL IN.</h2>
                        <p class="para">Most other resellers operate on a consignment basis. That means that when you
                            sell a bag, you
                            won’t receive a payment for the item until they sell it. Which could literally take weeks or
                            even months — if ever.</p>
                        <br>
                        <p class="para">At FASHIONPHILE, we like clean slates and clear terms. So to our sellers, we
                            offer full
                            buy-outs
                            on nearly every item, with immediate payment processing after the item arrives and is
                            authenticated. And to our buyers, we offer a 100% authenticity guarantee, point blank
                            period.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="head">3. THE BEST SERVICE, ALWAYS.</h2>
                        <p class="para">We provide many ways for you to buy and sell ultra-luxury to make your
                            experience, well,
                            luxurious. This includes free shipping and free returns (U.S. only, see page for terms).
                            Want to
                            try something out but don’t want to commit? We have a Refresh Program for that. Reserve
                            Luxury
                            Layaway which allows you to buy an item using payment installments over time so you can buy
                            that
                            must-have bag now even if you don't yet have all the funds available.</p>
                        <p class="para">We know that shopping online can leave you wanting more detail about your future
                            luxury
                            purchase,
                            that is why we have Personal Shoppers available for any questions that you may have about a
                            particular item. </p>

                        <h2 class="head">4. WE VALUE WHAT’S UNIQUE IN PEOPLE, IN PIECES, AND IN PERSPECTIVES.</h2>
                        <p class="para">As our Founder herself so aptly put it, “the more diversity we share — in
                            perspectives, in
                            ethnicity, in skin color, in culture, in sexual orientation, in religion and in all aspects
                            of
                            life, the better the product we produce and the better we are able to serve our diverse
                            customer
                            base.”</p>
                        <p class="para">In alignment with those values, we’re truly proud to say that our staff is a
                            highly diverse
                            group
                            of talented individuals. Their presence makes our team better, more creatively and
                            culturally
                            diverse, and more aligned with the people we serve.</p>
                        <p class="para">And like every person (regardless of their differences), our entire team is
                            always growing,
                            learning, and improving. We actively seek ways to better serve our customers and community,
                            especially those who are historically underserved. If you ever have a question or concern,
                            about
                            any topic, we’re here.
